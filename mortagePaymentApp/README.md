## 1. Mortgage Calculator App

I have created a simple project to calculate a mortgage. This project allows you to input the principal amount, annual interest rate, and period in years to calculate the mortgage payment.

### Instructions:

To run the Mortgage Calculator App:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the [`App.java`] file in the `mortagePaymentApp/src` folder.
3. Run the `main` method in the `App` class.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the required information.
5. The app will calculate the mortgage payment and display the result.
