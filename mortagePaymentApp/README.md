## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Mortgage Calculator App

I have created a simple project in Java to calculate a mortgage. This project allows you to input the principal amount, annual interest rate, and period in years to calculate the mortgage payment.

To run the Mortgage Calculator App:
1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Navigate to the `App.java` file in the `src` folder.
3. Run the `main` method in the `App` class.
4. Follow the prompts to enter the required information.
5. The app will calculate the mortgage payment and display the result.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this project as needed!
